This was a fun learning experience. First off, I learned about using back button focus on my camera. This allows you to lock the focus on your target before you press the shutter. Normally a half press of the shutter will lock the focus. Honestly, I like having the second button. It feels awkward to half press then full press to focus and take a photo.

Secondly, I learned about using the panorama tools in Affinity Photo. That really causes my computer to think but its way better than doing it manually. Now I just need to learn how to take the photo so it doesn't create an s-curve in the final image.
