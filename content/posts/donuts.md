I had a lot of fun editing this photo. I learned a new technique in Affinity Photo. I wanted to separate the neon sign from the rest of the image. My first attempt at doing this was by duplicating the image layers, but that caused them to blend together. So I followed a guide on how to isolate and group a set of layers away from the rest of the image. Affinity also has a 'Selection from layer' tool that allowed me to inversely edit the rest of the image to be black and white. This works but it leaves a hard edge. I can use a guass blur to soften that edge and a brush but it's not perfect. I bet there's a way to do a custom shape instead of a selection but for now this works.

Shout out to my friend for telling me it looks bad until I got to this edit. lol
