I can't believe I found this small rose.

It's always nice to see roses. While the rose is a little bit out of focus I still like the way it looks. I enjoy most of the pictures I take but it's always fun to edit them in Affinity Photo. I get to learn new skills and adjust the image to how I see it when I'm taking the photo. However, this image is the first image that I've posted where I didn't do any editing. I liked the lighting and the colors that I naturally captured. If I did edit this image I would bring out the pink of the rose and pull distraction away from the curb.
