Like with all the images I start to edit I have no clue to what I want to do.

I got kinda annoyed with this one. I like the angle of the shot but I didn't like the colors. The sky constantly wanted to be a very light blue. But I tweaked the blue and the green to remove that sort of overcast sky look. 

I'm usually wearing dark sunglasses when I take photos and I try to match the colors I see.
