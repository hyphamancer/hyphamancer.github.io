So I'm using affinity photo to focus merge this frog. This camera is new to me and I learned after this image I can use auto focus and manual focus at the same time. Some of the images I took had the frogs eyes in focus and some had its body but none of them had its mouth. sadge :( I also adjusted the colors of the frog to be more vibrant.
