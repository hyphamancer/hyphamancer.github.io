So I wasn't sure what to do with this picture at first.

But then a friend of mine suggested that I use black and white. "I was told by a photography professor once to not be afraid of the whitest whites and darkest darks."

I was trying to take this pic quickly so sadly the bug isn't in focus. Sometimes, bugs will stand still for a picture and sometimes they'll teleport away. I should said screw it and gotten closer. smh

Heres the version with color. This has less exposure and black point edits but I think it can be neat to see a before and after sometimes.
