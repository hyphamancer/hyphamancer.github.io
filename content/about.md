## Introduction

During Covid I picked up a Fujica ST-605. Analog photography is fun but I don't have the space for a whole ass darkroom. I found a guide on how to use a Raspberry Pi to take digital photos in an analog body.

Then I cam across a cheap Soligor lens that had a Konica mount. The Fujica is m42 and there's no reliable adapter. Because of where the sensor sits I don't have infinity focus so I don't need to worry about a weird mount but this gave me an excuse to buy another camera. >:) Frankly, the reason I wanted to buy the Konica is because the Fujica is tiny on the inside and I didn't want to cut the back of the camera door. The Fujica had a special place in my heart. 

I cut a hole in the back of the Konica so I could fit a ribbon cable out the back of it and close the door. This allowed me to close the camera door, not need a 3D printer to block out light, and fit the sensor closer to the focal point. I still don't have infinity focus but there's less of a crop. 

So the Konica looks like a natural SLR camera where as the Fujica looks a little wonky. I still like them both.
